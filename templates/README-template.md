# Title of the sample

<!--
This is how you want the sample to appear in the samples browser.
When naming your sample, try to give it a friendly name that describes what it does. Avoid using terms like `Microsoft 365 Developer Proxy` and `sample` -- because that's what all the samples in this repo are all about.

GOOD 👍:
  Simulating throttling on Microsoft Graph
BAD 👎:

## Summary

Short summary on the contents of the sample. Does it include presets, mocks, a plugin? What does it help the user achieve? What problem does it solve?

<!--
Please provide a high-quality screenshot of the sample in action. Include a screenshot of the terminal where the Proxy is using your sample and showing some related output, eg. if you've built a mock for an API, show how the Proxy mocks the response to an API call issued from curl, or a demo app.

Upload the image in a subfolder named `assets`. Use a resolution of 1920x1080.

You can add multiple screenshots to help users understand your samples without having to download  and install it.

PRO TIP:

For commands, use the `code syntax`. For button labels, page names, dialog names, etc. as they appear on the screen, use **Bold**. Don't use "click", use "select" or "use".

As tempting as it may be, don't just use images to describe the steps. Let's be as inclusive as possible and think about accessibility.

We have basic documentation for using mocks, presets and plugins that you can reference on top of any additional steps that your sample needs:

* [Change mocks file](https://github.com/microsoft/m365-developer-proxy/wiki/Change-mocks-file)
* [Use preset configurations](https://github.com/microsoft/m365-developer-proxy/wiki/Use-preset-configurations)
* [Plugin architecture](https://github.com/microsoft/m365-developer-proxy/wiki/Plugin-architecture)

-->

* Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/proxy-samples/tree/main/samples/YOUR-SOLUTION-NAME) then unzip it)
* ...provide further instructions
